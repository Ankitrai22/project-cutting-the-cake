<h1>
  Electricity sector in India
</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p>
  India is the third largest producer of electricity in the world.During the fiscal year (FY) 2019–20, the total electricity generation in the country was 1,598 TWh, of which 1,383.5 TWh generated by utilities. The gross electricity consumption per capita in FY2019 was 1,208 kWh.

In FY2015, electric energy consumption in agriculture was recorded as being the highest (17.89%) worldwide.The per capita electricity consumption is low compared to most other countries despite India having a low electricity tariff.

The national electric grid in India has an installed capacity of 409.1 GW as of 30 November 2022.Renewable power plants, which also include large hydroelectric power plants, constitute 40.7% of the total installed capacity. India has a surplus power generation capacity but lacks adequate fuel supply and power distribution infrastructure. The average capacity factor of thermal power plants is below 60% against the norm of 85%.

India's electricity sector is dominated by fossil fuels, in particular coal, which produced about three-quarters of the country's electricity. The government is making efforts to increase investment in renewable energy. The government's draft National Electricity Plan of 2022 states that the country does not need anymore fossil fuel power plants in the utility sector until 2027 besides those currently under construction.It is expected that non-fossil fuel generation contribution is likely to be around 44.7% of the total gross electricity generation by 2029–30.

  The first demonstration of electric light in Calcutta (now Kolkata) was conducted on 24 July 1879 by P.W. Fleury & Co. On 7 January 1897, Kilburn & Co secured the Calcutta electric lighting license as agents of the Indian Electric Co, which was registered in London on 15 January 1897. A month later, the company was renamed the Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation. The control of the company was transferred from London to Calcutta only in 1970. The introduction of electricity in Calcutta was a success, and power was next introduced in Bombay (now Mumbai). The first electric lighting demonstration in Mumbai was in 1882 at Crawford Market and the Bombay Electric Supply & Tramways Company (BEST) set up a generating station in 1905 to provide electricity for the tramway.

The first hydroelectric installation in India was installed near a tea estate at Sidrapong for the Darjeeling Municipality in 1897. The first electric street light in Asia was lit on 5 August 1905 in Bangalore.The first electric train in the country ran on the Harbour Line between Bombay's Victoria Terminus and Kurla on 3 February 1925. The first high-voltage laboratory of India was established at the Government Engineering College, Jabalpur in 1947. On 18 August 2015, Cochin International Airport became the world's first fully solar powered airport with the inauguration of a dedicated solar plant.

  India began using grid management on a regional basis in the 1960s. Individual State grids were interconnected to form 5 regional grids covering mainland India, the Northern, Eastern, Western, North Eastern and Southern Grids. These regional links were established to enable transmission of surplus electricity between states in each region. In the 1990s, the Indian government began planning for a national grid. Regional grids were initially interconnected by asynchronous high-voltage direct current (HVDC) back-to-back links facilitating the limited exchange of regulated power. The links were subsequently upgraded to high capacity synchronous links.

The first interconnection of regional grids was established in October 1991 when the North Eastern and Eastern grids were interconnected. The Western Grid was interconnected with these grids in March 2003. The Northern grid was also interconnected in August 2006, forming a Central Grid that was synchronously connected and operating at one frequency. The sole remaining regional grid, the Southern Grid, was synchronously interconnected to the Central Grid on 31 December 2013 with the commissioning of the 765 kV Raichur-Solapur transmission line, establishing the National Grid.

By the end of the calendar year 2015, despite poor hydroelectricity generation, India had become a power surplus nation with huge power generation capacity idling for want of demand.The calendar year 2016 started with steep falls in the international price of energy commodities such as coal, diesel oil, naphtha, bunker fuel, and liquefied natural gas (LNG), which are used in electricity generation in India. As a result of the global glut in petroleum products, these fuels became cheap enough to compete with pit head coal-based power generators.Coal prices have also fallen.Low demand for coal has led to coal stocks building up at power stations as well as coal mines.New installations of renewable energy in India surpassed installations of fossil fuel for the first time in 2016–17.

On 29 March 2017, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) stated that for the first time India has become a net exporter of electricity. India exported 5,798 GWh to neighboring countries, against a total import of 5,585 GWh.

The Government of India launched a program called "Power for All" in 2016. The program was accomplished by December 2018 in providing the necessary infrastructure to ensure uninterrupted electricity supply to all households, industries, and commercial establishments.Funding was made through a collaboration between the Government of India and its constituent states.

                <p>
                    There are various ways to pay your electricity bill in India, including online payment through the electricity board's website or mobile app, payment at a bank or post office, or payment through a third-party payment service provider. You can also set up automatic payment through your bank account or use the "bill desk" service, which allows you to pay your bills using your credit or debit card.

                <p>
                    If you experience a power outage, you should contact your local electricity board to report the problem. The electricity board will work to restore power as quickly as possible. In the meantime, you can try resetting your circuit breaker or checking to see if any appliances may be causing the outage.
